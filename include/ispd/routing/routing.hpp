/// \brief Szudzik's Pairing Function
///
/// This static function implements Szudzik's Pairing Function, which combines
/// two non-negative 32-bit integers 'a' and 'b' into a unique 64-bit unsigned
/// integer result. The returned integer is a combination of 'a' and 'b' that
/// ensures uniqueness for each pair (a, b).
///
/// Szudzik's pairing function provides a way to map a pair of integers onto a
/// single value, useful for hashing or indexing two-dimensional data
/// structures. It is a method to transform a pair of non-negative integers into
/// a single integer, allowing two-dimensional data to be represented as a
/// one-dimensional index.
///
/// The pairing function is defined as follows:
///
///     result = a >= b ? a * a + a + b : a + b * b
///
/// \param a The first non-negative 32-bit integer.
/// \param b The second non-negative 32-bit integer.
/// \return A 64-bit integer representing the unique pairing of 'a' and 'b'.
///
/// \note Szudzik's pairing function is invertible, meaning that it can be
///       reversed to extract 'a' and 'b' from the result.
//
///       However, it may lead to information loss if the original 'a' and 'b'
///       values exceed the 32-bit range. For larger integers, consider using
///       more advanced pairing functions or hash functions. The function
///       assumes that 'a' and 'b' are non-negative 32-bit integers. It may not
///       be suitable for negative integers or other data types without
///       modification. For mathematical details, refer to Szudzik's Pairing
///       Function definition.
